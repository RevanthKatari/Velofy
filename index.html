        <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>How accurate is the GPS speedometer?</h3>
          <p>Velofy Speed uses your device's GPS to provide highly accurate speed measurements. The accuracy depends on your GPS signal strength and typically ranges from 1-3 km/h precision under good conditions. Our advanced algorithms filter GPS noise to provide the most reliable speed readings possible.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I use this while driving?</h3>
          <p>Yes, Velofy Speed works great for driving, cycling, running, or any activity where you need to monitor your speed. The large, clear display makes it easy to read at a glance. However, always prioritize road safety and follow local laws regarding device usage while driving.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Does it work offline?</h3>
          <p>Yes! Once loaded, Velofy Speed works completely offline as it only uses your device's GPS for speed calculation. No internet connection required. This makes it perfect for remote areas or when you want to conserve data usage.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>What do the different colors mean?</h3>
          <p>The background color changes based on your speed: Blue (0-20 km/h) for low speeds, Teal (20-60 km/h) for moderate speeds, Yellow (60-120 km/h) for high speeds, and Red (120+ km/h) for very high speeds. This provides instant visual feedback of your current speed range.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Can I switch between km/h and mph?</h3>
          <p>Absolutely! Just tap the "km/h / mph" button to instantly switch between kilometers per hour and miles per hour. Your preference is automatically saved and will be remembered for future visits.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">
          <h3>Is this speedometer free to use?</h3>
          <p>Yes, Velofy Speed is completely free to use with no hidden costs, subscriptions, or premium features. We believe accurate speed tracking should be accessible to everyone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq-item">

        </ul>

        <h3>GPS Accuracy Tips</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Clear sky view</strong> - GPS works best with unobstructed view of the sky</li>
          <li><strong>Allow GPS warm-up</strong> - Wait for GPS to acquire satellite lock before relying on readings</li>
          <li><strong>Avoid tunnels and buildings</strong> - GPS signal may be weak or unavailable in covered areas</li>
          <li><strong>Check signal strength</strong> - Most devices show GPS signal strength in status bar</li>
          <li><strong>Calibration period</strong> - First few readings may be less accurate as GPS stabilizes</li>
          <li><strong>Weather considerations</strong> - Heavy cloud cover may slightly affect GPS accuracy</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Battery Conservation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Reduce screen brightness</strong> - Lower brightness when ambient light permits</li>
          <li><strong>Close unnecessary apps</strong> - Free up system resources for better GPS performance</li>
          <li><strong>Use power saving mode</strong> - Enable device power saving when battery is low</li>
          <li><strong>Consider external power</strong> - Use car charger for longer trips</li>
          <li><strong>Monitor battery temperature</strong> - Avoid overheating in direct sunlight</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Legal Considerations</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Speed limits</strong> - Always observe posted speed limits regardless of GPS readings</li>
          <li><strong>Device mounting laws</strong> - Check local regulations for proper device mounting</li>
          <li><strong>Hands-free operation</strong> - Ensure you can operate the device without taking hands off controls</li>
          <li><strong>Emergency situations</strong> - Know how to quickly access emergency features if needed</li>
          <li><strong>Professional use</strong> - Commercial drivers should check company policies on device usage</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h3>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>No GPS signal</strong> - Move to an area with better sky visibility</li>
          <li><strong>Inaccurate readings</strong> - Wait for GPS to stabilize, check for interference</li>
          <li><strong>App not loading</strong> - Check internet connection for initial load, clear browser cache</li>
          <li><strong>Slow updates</strong> - Close other apps using GPS, restart browser if needed</li>
          <li><strong>Battery drain</strong> - Reduce screen brightness, close background apps</li>
        </ul>
